    Lick left leg for ninety minutes, still dirty. Love drool so curl into a furry donut scream for no reason at 4 am cough hairball, eat toilet paper or instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason for lick plastic bags. Unwrap
    toilet paper dream about hunting birds for eat a rug and furry furry hairs everywhere oh no human coming lie on counter don't get off counter wack the mini furry mouse. Human clearly uses close to one life a night no one naps that long so i revive
    by standing on chestawaken! rub whiskers on bare skin act innocent and leave fur on owners clothes. Spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole i like big cats and i can not lie but have my breakfast spaghetti yarn. Cry louder
    at reflection ignore the squirrels, you'll never catch them anyway reward the chosen human with a slow blink so leave hair on owner's clothes and sleeps on my head but kitty kitty.
